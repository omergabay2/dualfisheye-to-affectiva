# dualfisheye-to-affectiva
this code made in order to recognize multiple faces expressions with 360 dualfisheye cameras.
I used theta S camera - capturing 360 dualfisheye images with 15 fps, but with little adjustments you can use any kind of 360 dual camera.
in order to use the code you need to get the affectiva program
https://www.affectiva.com/
I used ffmpeg to convert dualfisheye image to rectangular image.
the mapping file was created by "projection.c" program which can u find here.

you can create a mapping file for several cameras and resultoions.
