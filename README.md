# dualfisheye-to-affectiva
this code made in order to recognize multiple faces expressions with 360 dualfisheye cameras.
I used Theta S camera, but with little adjustments you can use any kind of 360 dual camera.
in order to use the code you need to get the affectiva program

theta S - capturing 360 dualfisheye images with 15 fps.

I used ffmpeg to convert dualfisheye image to rectangular image.
the mapping file was created by "projection.c" program which can u find here.
